Written by Giffy on the 11th of December 2010

Verified for PCI NAS01G with Firmware V3.33(09-14-2007).
Downloable from official site:
http://www.planex.net/driver/nas/NAS-01G/NAS-01G_FW_V3.33(09-14-2007)_Eng.zip

If no major changes has been introduced, this README should work as 
install guide regardless of version.

The guide describes how to install the Admin Menu Skin v.1.2 on a PCI
NAS01G. It has been tested in NAS01G but it should work on the following models
with some changes (not tested):
++ Allnet ALL6250, Encore ENNHD-1000, Vibe NS-349-U2, Eusso USS4500-I, Lindy 32455
Even:
++ Longshine LCS-8311, Fantec DB-C35 Giga LAN
 

If you have one of these models, please contact me and I could try to adapt 
to your NAS.


NOT TESTED
* Only tested on PCI NAS01G not in similar models.


PREREQUISITES
* Firmware 3.33 and ntx_libra.tgz

INSTALL
Unzip the NAS_01G-Admin_Menu_Skin_EN_v.1.2.zip in the share:
/mnt/Share 

With Windows you can access typing \\NAS-01G\Share or
 \\<IP-of-NAS>\Share on file explorer.


NAS_01G-Admin_Menu_Skin_EN_v.1.2.zip can be downloaded from RapidShare
find the link in: http://tumbosporjapon.wordpress.com

Backdoor file contains the commands to be included in Backdoor file.
Please copy the content on your Backdoor file or if you don't have any 
in your Share folder, you can keep as default.


START
Admin Menu Skin requires to reboot the NAS to install the WEBUI changes.


UNINSTALL
To Uninstall the Admin Menu Skin, just delete backdoor commands related to 
Admin Menu Skin (if you want to keep your commands) or delete the backdoor
file from share folder (it will delete your customized backdoor).

Menu_Update folder will remain in /mnt/www/ that can be deleted
by telnet.

Reboot the device and the official WEBUI will load.


REQUIREMENTS

Admin Menu Skin has been designed with some considerations

It is needed a HTTP server. I use Apache configured at port 80
with /mnt/www as root path for webs. 
Other HTTP servers have not been tested.

The Services and Transmission web pages use PHP. I use PHP 4.4.2

Transmission 2.04 can be configured through Admin Menu Skin, but 
Transmission web files will be located in 
/mnt/.local/share/transmission/web
or /usr/share/transmission/web  in both 
I use a link: ln -sf /mnt/.local/share /usr

NOTES

NAS_01G-Admin_Menu_Skin_EN_v.1.2.zip pack includes a file called dlna.tgz.

dlna.tgz is the DMS (Digital Media Server) included in ntx_libra.tgz (Firm v3.33)
because original dms file is replaced to allow start/stop the 
transmission-daemon service or dlna.


CHANGE LOG 14th Dec 2010:
Updated the below php files. The problem was that IP was fix to 192.168.1.109, with this update the php files identify the NAS IP and Admin Port.
 
transmissionform.php , transmission_stop.php , transmission_start.php , DLNA_stop.php , DLNA_start.php
