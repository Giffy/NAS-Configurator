HOW TO INSTALL
--------------
Please, it is recommended to install the NAS Configurator on a clean NAS. 
I recommend to format the hard disk (loosing all data!) and reset the
Factory default configuration. 

If it is installed without format the hard disk and you have done a
backdoor file, please backup the backdoor file.

1-  Download NAS-01G_NAS_Configurator from here, there are 2 files:
     backdoor
     NAS_configurator_v1.2.3b6.tgz
     

2-  Copy the two files to your root folder in the NAS-01G

3- Reboot NAS

Package includes a "backdoor" file that contains all the commands to 
install and run after reboot. 

Backdoor file must be keept in the folder to run NAS Configurator.
If backdoor file is deleted, NAS configurator will not run and factory
NAS WebUI will be shown.

START
-----

NAS Configurator will run after reboot the NAS while backdoor file is
keept.


UNINSTALL
---------

To Uninstall the Admin Menu Skin, just delete backdoor file or commands
(located in /mnt/Share folder).

And delete the Menu_Update folders, located in /mnt/Share and /mnt/www

Then reboot the device.


NOTES
-----

If NAS01G NTX_libra extension v3.33 is installed, DLNA service will be 
uninstalled. It happens because Web Configurator uses the script included
in 3.33 firmware to run and stop the services.

If you want to use the DNLA, just install the Digital Media Server pack
with 'package manager menu' and run and stop with 'switch services menu'.
